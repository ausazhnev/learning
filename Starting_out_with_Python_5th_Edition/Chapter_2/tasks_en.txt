Task #5
Traveled distance.
Assuming that there are no accidents or delays, then the distance traveled car on the freeway,
can be calculated based on the formula:
  - distance = speed * time.
The car is moving at a speed of 70 km/h. Write a program that shows:
  - the distance that the car will cover in 6 hours;
  - the distance that the car will cover in 10 hours;
  - is the distance traveled by the car in 15 hours.

Task #6
Sales tax.
Write a program that asks the user to enter a purchase amount. Then the program should calculate
federal and state sales taxes. Assume that the federal sales tax is 5%, and regional 2.5%. The
program should show the purchase amount, federal tax with sales, regional sales tax, total sales
tax, and total sales amount (i.e., the amount purchases and total sales tax).
Hint: to represent 2.5% use 0.025, to represent 5% use 0.05

Task #7
Gasoline consumption is not based on kilometers traveled.
Gasoline consumption per kilometers traveled by a car can be calculated based on the formula:
  - consumption = kilometers traveled / gasoline consumption in liters.
Write a program that prompts the user for the number of kilometers traveled and the consumption
gasoline in liters. It should calculate the fuel consumption of the car and show the result.

Task #9
Convert Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit temperature.
Write a program that converts temperature readings in Celsius to temperature in Fahrenheit scale
based on the formula:
  F = ((9/5)C) + 32
The program should ask the user to enter the Celsius temperature and show temperature converted
by the Fahrenheit formula.

Task #10
Ingredient regulator.
The recipe for buns includes the ingredients:
  - 1.5 cups of sugar;
  - 1 glass of oil;
  - 2.75 cups of flour.
With this many ingredients, this recipe makes 48 buns. Write a program that asks the user how
many buns he wants to make, and then shows the number of cups of each ingredient required for
a given number of buns.

Task #11
Percentage of students of both sexes.
Write a program that asks the user for the number of male and female students
sex registered in the study group. The program should show the percentage of male students and
female.
Hint: suppose that there are 8 boys and 12 girls in the study group, i.e. only 20 students.
The percentage of boys can be calculated as 8/20 = 0.4 or 40%. Percentage of girls: 12/20 = 0.6,
or 60%.

Task #12
The program for calculating the purchase and sale of shares.
Joe bought some shares in an IT company last month. Here is the detail of this purchase:
  - the number of acquired shares was 2000;
  - When buying shares, Joe paid $40.00 per share;
  - Joe paid his stockbroker a commission which amounted to 3% of the amount paid for shares.
Two weeks later, Joe sold the shares. Here are the details of the sale:
  - number of sold shares 2000;
  - he sold the shares for $42.75 per share;
  - Joe paid his stockbroker a commission which amounted to 3% of the amount received for shares.
Write a program that displays the following information:
  - the amount of money paid for the shares;
  - the amount of commissions paid to the broker when buying shares;
  - the amount for which Joe sold the shares;
  - the amount of commission paid to the broker when selling shares;
is the amount of money Joe had left when he sold the shares and paid his broker (both times).
If this amount is positive, then Joe has made a profit. If it is negative, then Joe took a loss.

Task #13
Growing grapes.
A vineyard owner is planting several new vine beds and needs to know how much vines should be
planted on each bed. Having measured the length of the future ridge, he decided that in order to
calculate the number of vines that will fit on the ridge along with the final supports to be
placed at the end of each bed, he may apply the below formula:
  V = (R - 2E) / S
where V - is the number of vines that will fit in the ridge; R - is the length of the ridge in
meters; E - is the size of the space in meters occupied by the end supports; S - distance between
vines in meters.
Write a program that performs calculations for the owner of a vineyard. This program should ask
the user to enter:
  - the length of the ridge in meters;
  - space occupied by vines in meters;
  - distance between vines in meters.
After the input data has been entered, the program should calculate and display the number vines
that will fit on the ridge.

Task #14
Compound interest.
When a bank calculates interest income, it calculates interest income income not only on the
amount that was deposited to the deposit account, but also on interest income that accumulates
over a long period of time. A little savings account income and goal income in the long run
number of years. Below is the formula for determining the amount of residue after quantitation.
years:
  A = P(1+(r/n))^nt
where A - is the amount of money in the account after a specific number of years; P - is the
principal amount, which was deposited into the account at the beginning; r - annual interest
rate; n - frequency of interest accrual income per year; t - is a specific number of years.
Write a program that does the calculations for you. The program should ask the user enter:
  - the principal amount deposited in the savings account at the very beginning;
  - the annual interest rate accrued on the balance of the account;
  - the frequency of accrual of interest income per year (for example, if interest is accrued
  monthly, then enter 12; if interest income is accrued quarterly, then enter 4);
  - the number of years during which the savings account will earn interest income.
After the input data is entered, the program should calculate and display the amount of money,
which will be in the account after a given number of years.
Note: The user must enter the interest rate as a percentage. For example, 2% will be entered as
2, not as 0.2. The program must itself divide the entered number by 100 in order to move the
decimal point to the correct position.
